# MeetingMinutes

This is curently just a simple cmd interface to take timestamped notes for classes.

I plan on implementing the following:
1)Making it automatically choose what class I am in based on the current day of week and time.
2)Add a way to store and add classes through a seperate cmd line interface
3)Seperate the logic and display


Pontential future plans include:
1)Switching to an xcode codebase in order to make it onto the mac appstore
2)Add recording as an option(Video and/or Audio)
3)Searchable
4)Toggle for making the time copy-able on the fly(In case someone doesn't want the timestamp)
